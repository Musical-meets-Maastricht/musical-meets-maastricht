My name is **Daniel**, I am studying **medicine** and I love big, ambitious projects. So that is where this monster is coming from I guess.

In highschool (The Hague), I was always involved with the musical productions we did and I have fulfilled all kinds of tasks from musician to producer or main character on stage. In my gap year before coming to Maastricht, I spent my time arranging sheet usic for musicals and getting to understand the orchestration of a real show. With this backpack, I cam to Limburg where I live, in a small town near Valkenburg, and I was looking for a new challenge.

While talking to some people during INKOM, I came to the conclusion that Maastricht is lacking something: **A musical production for students**. Luckily, rather quickly, I met Laura who just finished an extraordinary production of Cabaret and she was in the same dreamy world as I was. We were determined to build up something similar. A year later, we still are and I am glad to announce that I will be the **musical director** of a production organized by Musical Meets Maastricht. Sounds pretty cool, right?

**So I am looking froward to meeting you as a part of the show !**

Hello, my name is **Laura**. I am a second-year bachelor's student enrolled in **Circular Engineering**.

I have been dancing since I was 4 years old, and have always loved performing on stage. Two years ago, I had the opportunity to be part of a musical performance club, performing Cabaret and touring in Bulgaria and Serbia.My love for musicals started expanding after that. I knew that I wanted to continue this project abroad, so I had the idea of creating such a club/association at Maastricht University.

This association is slowly getting started and will definitely be on the list with all the other great student associations. Our club, Musical Meets Maastricht, aims to **give students the opportunity to perform and bring the magical world of Musicals to Maastricht**.

I will be the **main producer** of the team. Even though I have a dance background and will be involved in choreographing, I will mainly be in charge of the creation, maintenance and logistics of the production.

With this kind of project, I will guarantee you that **everything you will learn in the making process will have a substantial positive impact on your future life**.
