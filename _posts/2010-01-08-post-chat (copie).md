This team is in charge of all the **production** outside of all the other teams. 

We need help for **marketing**. If you are good with **pictures** or have any kind of **material** that could be used, if you are good with **designing logos or posters**, if you are good with **social media** and like to write and document the advancement of the club, then this section is good for you.

We need people that are good at **speaking** to people and to sponsors. We are going to **need money** to create such a production, so finding the money is going to be one big task. Also if you like organizing money and creating spreadsheet, then you will be great as the **treasurer**. 

We are also going to **organize events**, **parties**, **shows** for people to discover our club. If you like **organizing small events** for other students, you are also more than welcome in our team.


>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us. You can use the club's mail or contact directly the producer, Laura. 

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
