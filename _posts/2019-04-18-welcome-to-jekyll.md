This team is in charge of **creating the choreographies**, to learn them and teach them to the future cast.

If you **love dancing** and choreographing and would like to make your **own creations** for the story, then this might be your chance. **Any type** of background in dancing is welcome, as long as you enjoy the big band and jazzy swing type of music that fit the musical genre. It would be superb to have dancers from different styles, it opens up the team's creativity. It can be **ballet**, **jazz**, **contemporary**, **hip-hop**, **tap dancing**, and many others. 

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us.

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
