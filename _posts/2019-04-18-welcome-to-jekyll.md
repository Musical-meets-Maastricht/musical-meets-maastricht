This team is in charge of **creating the choreographies**, to learn them and teach them to the future cast.

If you **love dancing** and choreographing and would like to make your **own creations** for the story, then this might be your chance. **Any type** of background in dancing is welcome. Of course, jazz and tap dancing are the main genre for musicals, however, it is not that much of a problem. It is actually better if we have dancers from other genres, it opens up the team's creativity. It can be **ballet**, **jazz**, **contemporary**, **hip-hop**, **tap dancing**, and many others. 

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us. You can use the club's mail or contact directly the producer, Laura. 

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
