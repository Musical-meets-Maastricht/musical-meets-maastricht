This team is in charge of creating, designing and organizing the **costumes** and the **decors** for the stage.

If you are interested in **designing**, **drawing** and love **manual work**, this is for you. We need people that have a **creative mind** and willing to use their hands to build **new stages** or even costumes and props if you are good at it. 

This team will also be the **stage managers** during the performance. They are in charge of making sure that all the **transitions** are done correctly, that people are on the **right spot and on time**, that everything runs smoothly **on stage and in backstage**.

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us. You can use the club's mail or contact directly the producer, Laura. 

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
