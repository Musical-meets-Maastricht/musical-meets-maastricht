This team is in charge of all the **technical aspect** of a stage performance.

If you have great knowledge about how **mics work** or what equipment is used for stage performances, or know about **lights** on stage and want to be changing the lighting during the actual performance, then this is for you. 

Light and sound is a **major** component of a **successful performance**, and therefore, having a team in charge of this space will allow us to do **more and better**. 

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us. You can use the club's mail or contact directly the producer, Laura. 

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
