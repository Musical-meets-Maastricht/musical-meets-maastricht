This team is in charge of all the **technical aspect** of a stage performance.

If you have experience in **theatre** technique, stage **equipment**, know about **lighting** and/or want to be pushing and shoving the **buttons** during the performance, then this is your team. 

Light and sound is a **major** component of a **successful performance**, and therefore, we would love having you on the team.

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us.

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
