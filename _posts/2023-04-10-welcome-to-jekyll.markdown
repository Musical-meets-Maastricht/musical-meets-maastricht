Musical meets Maastricht is a **new association** project that has not yet opened. 

The project of the club is to produce a big and **full scale musical** production with students and perform it on the stages of Maastricht. It is an **amateur** club which means that it is non professional and non lucrative. It is a great experience to learn how to **manage a team**, use our 'secret' talents and share it to others, to learn all of the management behind one show, to discover new stories and new hobbies, and to meet **new people**. 

We are very enthusiastic about the project and we are sure that many others share the same love as us for dance, music, stage performance and musicals. In order for us to start the association and to start organizing the production, **we need a team**. For now, we are a team of two. Daniel Baai is the Music director, and Laura Schellerup is the Main producer.*(you can read about us on About)* **However, we need people to be in charge of the other parts of the production**. 

We need **choreographers and dancers**, we need **singers and musicians**, we need **artists and designers**, we need a **technical team in charge of light and sound**, and we need more people in charge of the production team for **marketing**, **sponsorship**, **organization**,... The following posts describes these different parts separately with examples. 

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us.

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
