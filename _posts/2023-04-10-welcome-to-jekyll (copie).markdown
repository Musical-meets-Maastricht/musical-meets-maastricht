This team is in charge of the **vocal aspect and the orchestra**.

Music is the main part of a musical, therefore, we need a specific team for it. If you like **singing**, have a great **voice** and want to perform on stage this is for you. As a music assistant, we need to make sure that not only you **can sing** but have also some **theory in music and notes**.

If you are a **musician**, love to play on stage, then you are more than welcome to join this team and be in charge of the **orchestra or band**.

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us. You can use the club's mail or contact directly the producer, Laura. 

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
