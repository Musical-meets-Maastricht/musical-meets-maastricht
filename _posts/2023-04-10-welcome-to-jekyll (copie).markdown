This team is in charge of all **music related aspects**.

Music is the thing that makes musical work. We need **experienced singers** that want to lead the vocal coaching of the cast and dancers. We need people with experience in **composing and writing music** to arrange sheet music and make fitting parts for all musicians, as well as writing fitting underscores etc. If you **play an instrument** and want to help with (sectional) orchestra rehearsals you are also welcome in the team!

The most important thing is that you are **flexible** and **commited** to making something really cool and spectacular! 

>If you are interested or not yet sure but still want to help and support us, don't hesitate to contact us. 

>Lets bring the magic of musicals on the stages of Maastricht together.
